This project encompasses three key areas of computational and machine learning techniques. The first module focuses on derivative calculations, enabling users to compute the rate of change of mathematical functions, which is essential in various fields like physics and optimization. The second module implements Gradient Descent, an iterative optimization algorithm widely used in machine learning to minimize functions and train models effectively. Lastly, the project includes a Face Recognition system that utilizes advanced image processing and machine learning techniques to detect, identify, and verify faces in images or videos, making it applicable in security, authentication, and user personalization.
